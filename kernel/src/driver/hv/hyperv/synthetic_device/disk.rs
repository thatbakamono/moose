//! |------------------|------------|------------------------------------------|
//! | Read sectors     | `0x28`     | READ(10) — up to 65535 sectors per call  |
//! | Write sectors    | `0x2A`     | WRITE(10) — up to 65535 sectors per call |
//! | Flush cache      | `0x35`     | SYNCHRONIZE CACHE(10)                    |
//! | Read capacity    | `0x25`     | READ CAPACITY(10) — returns sector count |
//!
//! For transfers larger than [`MAX_SECTORS_PER_REQUEST`] the public API
//! automatically splits the I/O into multiple sequential SRBs.
//!
//! # Per-request gates
//!
//! Every in-flight SRB gets its own [`OneshotGate`] stored in
//! [`PendingRequest`]. The ISR looks up the gate by `request_id` in a
//! [`BTreeMap`] and opens it; the submitting thread blocks only on its own
//! gate, so multiple callers can issue concurrent I/Os without interfering
//! with each other.
