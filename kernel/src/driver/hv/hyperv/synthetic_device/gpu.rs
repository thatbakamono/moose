//! # Hyper-V Synthetic Video Protocol
//!
//! The communication happens over the VMBus channel for synthetic video, using a sequence of
//! well-defined messages in a fixed initialization and runtime order.
//!
//! ## Protocol Flow
//!
//! The typical initialization and update flow is as follows:
//!
//! 1. **Guest → Host**
//!    [`SyntheticVideoProtocolVersionRequest`]
//!    The guest negotiates the supported protocol version with the host.
//!
//! 2. **Host → Guest**
//!    [`SyntheticVideoProtocolVersionResponse`]
//!    The host responds, indicating whether the requested version is accepted and providing its own version information.
//!
//! 3. **Host → Guest**
//!    [`SyntheticVideoFeatureChange`]
//!    The host informs the guest of required updates or features that need attention (e.g., resolution change, cursor update).
//!
//! 4. **Guest → Host**
//!    [`SyntheticVideoSupportedResolutionsRequest`]
//!    The guest requests the list of supported resolutions and related EDID data.
//!
//! 5. **Host → Guest**
//!    [`SyntheticVideoSupportedResolutionsResponse`]
//!    The host provides available resolutions, default resolution index, and display configuration details.
//!
//! 6. **Guest → Host**
//!    [`SyntheticVideoVramLocation`]
//!    The guest specifies the location of the video framebuffer in guest physical address space.
//!
//! 7. **Host → Guest**
//!    [`SyntheticVideoVramLocationAck`]
//!    The host acknowledges the framebuffer location.
//!
//! 8. **Guest → Host**
//!    [`SyntheticVideoPointerPosition`]
//!    The guest communicates the position and visibility state of the pointer (cursor).
//!
//! 9. **Guest → Host**
//!    [`SyntheticVideoPointerShape`]
//!    The guest sends pointer (cursor) bitmap.
//!
//! 10. **Guest → Host**
//!     [`SyntheticVideoSituationUpdate`]
//!     The guest provides information about the current display situation (resolution, pitch, VRAM offsets).
//!
//! 11. **Host → Guest**
//!     [`SyntheticVideoSituationUpdateAck`]
//!     The host acknowledges the situation update.
//!
//! 12. **Guest → Host**
//!     [`SyntheticVideoDirt`] (repeated many times during operation)
//!     The guest periodically informs the host of dirty rectangles in the framebuffer that need to be redrawn.
//!
//! ## Runtime Behavior
//!
//! After initialization, the protocol mainly revolves around `Dirt` messages, where the guest keeps notifying
//! the host about updated framebuffer regions. Pointer position/shape changes can also be sent at any time
//! if user input or cursor state changes.
//!
//! This sequence ensures the host is always aware of the current screen configuration and can refresh
//! the display efficiently.
//!
//! ## Sequence Diagram
